Taipei: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that her delegation had come to Taiwan in "peace for the region" after the visit enraged Beijing and set off a diplomatic firestorm.
She landed in Taiwan late Tuesday, defying a string of increasingly stark warnings and threats from China, which views Taiwan as its territory and had warned it would consider her visit a major provocation.

Pelosi, second in line to the presidency, is the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.

"We come in friendship to Taiwan, we come in peace to the region," she said during a meeting with Tsai Chi-chang, the deputy speaker of Taiwan's parliament.
